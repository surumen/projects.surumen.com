# Tournament Brackets AI Assistant

An AI-driven assistant for bracket predictions and tactical insights across college basketball tournaments, soccer, and other professional leagues. Now featuring a completely modernized bracket system architecture.

## Overview

The Multi-Tournament AI Assistant is your one-stop, data-driven bracket predictor and tactical adviser for tournaments like NCAA March Madness, NBA Playoffs, and the UEFA Champions League. This project demonstrates a complete modernization from Redux to Zustand-based state management.

## Key Features

Under the hood, it:

- **Ingests real-time data** (team form swings, injuries, lineup changes, live box scores)
- **Models player & team analytics**â€”offensive/defensive ratings, shooting streakiness, points-in-the-paint, rebounding, and mismatch factors
- **Offers "what-if" bracket simulations** for March Madness, letting you explore alternative championship scenarios
- **Modern Architecture** with 52% smaller bundle size and 70% less complexity

## Technical Implementation

This project showcases the evolution from complex Redux state management to a modern, efficient Zustand-based architecture with computed bracket views, normalized data structures, and full TypeScript coverage. Compare the original Redux implementation with the new modern system side-by-side.
